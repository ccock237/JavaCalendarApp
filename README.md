# JavaCalendarApp
This application was developed my last semester at Tri-County Technical College. The Calendar Application was developed in IntelliJ using Java. This calendar application was my first GUI project for school and posed many challenges, but I learned a lot from this project and will enjoy the next time I have the opportunity to develop a GUI in java. To run the application:

1. Download the repository or MyCalendarApp.jar
2. Find and click on MyCalendarApp.jar
